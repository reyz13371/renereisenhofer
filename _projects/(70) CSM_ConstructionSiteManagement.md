### 🏗️ Project Overview

CSM (Construction Site Manager) is a diploma project developed by a team of four students to digitize lean management processes on construction sites.  
The goal was to replace physical Post-it-based workflows with a centralized, real-time software solution for both site supervisors and workers.

The system consists of a **desktop application for site management (ÖBA)** and a **mobile application for on-site workers**, designed to function reliably even in environments with limited or no internet connectivity.

Project planning, task tracking, and sprint organization were managed using a **Jira board**, following an agile Scrum-based workflow.
