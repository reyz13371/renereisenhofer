  description: I completed my secondary technical education at HTL Pinkafeld from 2014 to 2018. The curriculum covered a broad range of subjects, including network systems and cybersecurity, computer architecture and operating systems, software engineering and programming, web and mobile development, game development, data science and AI, business management (accounting and business organization), system planning and project management, as well as databases and information systems. For my final project, I worked in a team to create a software solution, which allowed me to apply my skills in a real-world setting and strengthen my experience in collaborative software engineering.
