# **About Me**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
an aspiring Software Engineer from Austria with a passion for the gaming and esports industry. In March 2026, I will start my bachelor’s degree in Games Programming at SAE Institute in Vienna.

This portfolio primarily showcases my game development projects, as this is my current main focus. However, I’m happy to share other projects upon request to demonstrate a broader range of skills and experiences.

I am currently looking for a job where I can prove myself and - most importantly - continue developing my coding and software development skills.
