# **About Me**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
an aspiring Software Engineer from Austria with a passion for the gaming and esports industry. In March 2026, I will start my bachelor’s degree in Games Programming at SAE Institute in Vienna.

This portfolio showcases some of my projects. I’m happy to share other projects upon request to demonstrate a broader range of skills and experiences.

I am currently looking for a job where I can prove myself and - most importantly - continue developing my coding and software development skills.
